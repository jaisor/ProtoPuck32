# ProtoPuck32

Multi-purpose prototype box based on ESP32

## Development

USB driver for Windows required: [Silicon Labs CP210X](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

Recommended: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)

## Issues

LittleFS_esp32 library installed by PlatformIO seems broken, complaining about 

```
error: unknown field 'utime_p' specified in initializer
```
Replacing `libdeps/LittleFS_esp32` with downliad from [LittleFS_esp32](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/little-fs_esp32) fixes it

# Bugs / TODO

1. Connecting to Wifi AP after creating one fails - probably something needs to be cleaned up in the WiFi instances
1. Configuration menu
1. Remote controlled pixels via WiFi (HTTP Post or MQTT)
1. Report sensors data and config out to HTTP or MQTT
1. Remote control of config like brightness, mode, etc.
